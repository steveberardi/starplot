    Similar to the North/South Stereographic projection, but this version is location-dependent.

    The Zenith projection shows the whole sky as seen from a specific time and place. They're also sometimes called "star charts" but that name is used for many different types of star maps, so Starplot uses the more specific name "Zenith plot" (which reflects the fact that the [zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith) is in the center of the chart).
