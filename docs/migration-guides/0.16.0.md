# Migrating to v0.16 (from v0.15)

This page summarizes the major changes between version 0.15 and 0.16.

## Observer Model

There is now an [Observer model][starplot.Observer] which represents a time and place. It takes a datetime, lat, and lon.

All plot types now require an observer instance. By default the map plot will use a default Observer.

Example:

```python

# Create observer
observer = Observer(
    dt=datetime(2023, 7, 13, 22, 0, tzinfo=ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles")),
    lat=33.363484,
    lon=-116.836394,
)

# Use the observer in a horizon plot
p = HorizonPlot(
    altitude=(0, 70),
    azimuth=(320, 435),
    observer=observer,
    ...
)

```

## Projections

[Projections are now classes](/reference-mapplot/#projections) instead of an enum. This was a difficult decision, but I think it's the best way to allow customizing the central RA/DEC of projections, and this is something I really wanted to support.

The map plot is still the only plot type that requires a projection.

Also new: an equidistant projection!

Example:

```python
from starplot import Equidistant

p = MapPlot(
    dec_min=0,
    projection=Equidistant(center_dec=90),
    ...
)

```

## Zenith Plot

Zenith plots are now a separate plot type. They do inherit from map plots, so they still support all the same functions.

Example:

```python
from starplot import ZenithPlot, Observer

observer = Observer(
    dt=datetime(2023, 7, 13, 22, 0, tzinfo=ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles")) ,
    lat=33.363484,
    lon=-116.836394,
)

p = ZenithPlot(
    observer=observer,
    ...,
)

```
