# 4 - Creating a Basic Map

The zenith plot is known as a [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)), which means it depends on a time and place. They're useful for many things in astronomy, but Starplot also lets you create general-purpose maps of the sky that are independent of location.

To create a general map, you use the `MapPlot` class, which works similar to the zenith plot but takes a few different parameters:

- `projection`: Instance of a Projection, which is the method to use for transforming the curved shape of the three-dimensional sky to a flat two-dimensional map. In this example, we use a `Mercator` projection, but Starplot supports many [types of projections](/reference-mapplot/#map-projections) and you can customize their properties (e.g. central RA/DEC).
- `ra_min` / `ra_max` : Right ascension (RA) extent of the map (in degrees)
- `dec_min` / `dec_max` : Declination (DEC) extent of the map (in degrees)

Here's a code example that creates a MapPlot of the area around Orion:

```python linenums="1"

*In the [next section](05.md), we'll learn how to create an optic plot which shows an area of the sky when viewed through an optic (such as binoculars or a telescope)...*
