[Callables](/reference-callables/) allow you to define your own functions for calculating a few of the style properties for stars: size, alpha (opacity),  color, and their labels. DSOs support callables for alpha and labels only. Starplot has a few basic callables built-in, but you can also create your own.

Here's an example that uses the built-in callable `color_by_bv` to create an optic plot of [Antares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares) that colorizes the stars based on their B-V index (Antares B-V is 1.83 so it appears red/orange in the sky):

For more details on using callables and an example of how to create your own, check out the [reference page](/reference-callables/).

*In the [next section](09.md), we'll learn where to go from here...*
