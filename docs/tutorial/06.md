When plotting stars or deep sky objects (DSOs), you may want to limit the plotted objects by more than just a limiting magnitude. Starplot provides a way to [filter stars/DSOs by using expressions](/reference-selecting-objects/). This allows you to be very specific about which objects to plot, and it also gives you a way to style objects differently (e.g. if you want to style very bright stars differently than dim stars).

To select objects to plot, you pass a list of expressions using the `where` keyword argument. For example, here's how you'd plot all stars that have a magnitude less than 6 and a B-V index of more than 0.4:

```python
p.stars(
    where=[
        Star.magnitude < 6,
        Star.bv > 0.4,
    ],
)
```
When passing the `where` kwarg, the `mag` kwarg will be ignored, and only the stars/DSOs that satisfy ALL the `where` conditions will be plotted. You can reference any field on the [model](/reference-models/) in expressions, and there are also a few functions available for determining if a field is null or is in a list of values. For complete details about selecting objects, see the [reference page](/reference-selecting-objects/).

Here's some code that uses the `where` kwarg extensively to produce the image above:
