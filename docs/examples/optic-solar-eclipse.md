# Total Solar Eclipse 2024 {.example-header}

![optic-moon-saturn](/images/examples/optic_solar_eclipse.png)

This example shows the Moon and Sun _about 30 minutes before_ the total solar eclipse that occurred on [April 8, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024), as seen from Cleveland, Ohio.

The total eclipse started at 15:13:46 Eastern Time, so if you set that as the time then you'll see the dark moon completely block the Sun (you can confirm the Sun was plotted by accessing the plot's [`objects.sun`][starplot.OpticPlot.objects] property).
