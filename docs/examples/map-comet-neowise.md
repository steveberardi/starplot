# Map of Comet NEOWISE {.example-header}

![map-comet-neowise](/images/examples/map_comet_neowise.png)

Here's an example that uses [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) to get some data on the comet [NEOWISE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_NEOWISE) ☄️ and then uses that data to plot the comet's location in the sky in July 2020:

!!! star "Note"

    Skyfield is a required dependency of Starplot (and a very important one!), so if you have Starplot installed, then Skyfield should be installed too.
