**Horizon plots show what the sky looks like from the horizon at a specific time and place**. They can help illustrate answers to questions like "what stars will I see in the sky tonight at 9pm when I look directly West from my backyard?"

These plots use the [Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_azimuthal_equal-area_projection), with the horizon as the central altitude (0 degrees) and the central azimuth is determined by the azimuth range you define when creating the plot.

Stars on horizon plots are plotted in their [_apparent_ positions](reference-positions.md).
