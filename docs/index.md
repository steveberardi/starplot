Starplot is a Python library for creating star charts and maps of the sky.

- ‚≠ê **Zenith Plots** - showing the stars from a specific time/location

- üó∫Ô∏è **Map Plots** - including stereographic and perspective projections

- üî≠ **Optic Plots** - simulates what you'll see through an optic (e.g. telescope) from a time/location

- ü™ê **Planets and Deep Sky Objects (DSOs)**

- üé® **Custom Styles** - for all objects

- üì• **Export** - png, svg, jpeg

- üß≠ **Label Collision Avoidance**

!!! star "Starplot is still a 'work in progress'"

    Starplot is still very much a work in progress, and under active development. We try to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which means that [_anything_ can change between versions before `1.0.0`](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

    However, the Starplot API becomes more stable with each new version. We anticipate that version `1.0.0` is still at least a year away. The best way to help us get there faster is to [join as a contributor](https://github.com/steveberardi/starplot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) üòÉ help is wanted and very much appreciated!
