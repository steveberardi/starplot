# Data Catalogs - Overview

Starplot has a [Catalog][starplot.data.Catalog] class that represents a catalog of sky objects. They're currently supported for the following object types:  stars, constellations, and deep sky objects (DSOs).

There are a few officially supported catalogs, but you can also [build your own](building.md).

All catalogs are stored as [Parquet](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/apache-parquet) files to allow fast object lookup.
