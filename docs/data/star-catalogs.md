Starplot has two available star catalogs:

- `big-sky-mag11` - this is an abridged version of the full Big Sky catalog and is bundled with Starplot. It's the default catalog used when plotting stars. It contains all stars from Big Sky with a limiting magnitude of 11, total stars = 981,852.
- `big-sky` - this is the full Big Sky catalog and will be downloaded when you first reference it. The catalog contains 2,557,500 stars.
