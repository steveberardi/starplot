Callables allow you to define your own functions for calculating a few of the style properties for stars: size, alpha (opacity), and color. Starplot has a few basic callables built-in, but you can also define your own!


## Built-In Callables

All of these are importable from `starplot.callables`

::: starplot.callables
    options:
        inherited_members: true
        merge_init_into_class: true
        <!-- show_root_heading: true -->
        docstring_section_style: list
        <!-- separate_signature: true -->
