**Zenith plots show the entire sky as seen from a specific time and place.** They're also often called "star charts" or "all-sky charts." Starplot calls them zenith plots because the zenith is at the center of the plot.

Stars on zenith plots are plotted in their [_astrometric_ positions](reference-positions.md).
